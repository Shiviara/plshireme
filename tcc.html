        <p>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Clothing Club (TCC)</span> is a non-profit, volunteer based organization
          in Aarhus, which works as a <span style="font-weight: bold;">clothing library</span>, where for a set price,
          its members can rent up to 3 pieces of clothing per month. They has
          existed for 5 years, but they only means of communication with the
          target audience were Instagram and Facebook posts. Recently, they
          decided to rebrand their digital presence and invest in a <span style="font-weight: bold;">website</span>.

        <p>
          We want to <span style="font-weight: bold;">increase the awareness</span> of The Clothing Club among their
          potential customers and <span style="font-weight: bold;">develop</span> their <span style="font-weight: bold;">digital presence</span>.

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          We wanted to understand how TCC’s members and potential customers feel
          about the concept, what are their <span style="font-weight: bold;">reasons for joining</span> and how would
          they <span style="font-weight: bold;">describe</span> the organization’s <span style="font-weight: bold;">aesthetic</span>. Additionally, TCC was
          discussing adding a catalogue on their website, so we wanted to learn
          the opinion of the target audience about it.
          <p>The examples of questions were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why have you started using their service?</li>
            <li>How would you describe their aesthetic/branding?</li>
            <li>What do you think can be improved?</li>
            <li>What might be a leaning argument for you to sign up? (for the potential customers)</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>Based on desk research and the interviews we created 2 user personas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sarah Jakobsen - a Danish student, who wants to save money and the planet at the same time.</li>
          <li>Anna Müller - an international member of The Clothing Club, who wants to become a bigger part of the community, while learning new skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both of them like to thrift and experiment with fashion. It helped us <span style="font-weight: bold;">define our target group</span> 
          better and always <span style="font-weight: bold;">remember their needs</span>.</p>

        <p>We formed How Might We questions to <span style="font-weight: bold;">ideate on the potential solutions</span> for the problems our users might face while using the website. 
          First, we took our long-term and short-term goals for the solution from our previous research, in spirit of:
          <ul>
            <li>Promoting sustainability</li>
            <li>Attracting new members</li>
            <li>Creating an open and supportive community</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We voted for the most important and achievable outcomes</p>

        <div class="textImg">
          
          <div>
        <p>Later we took those challenges and we asked ourselves <span style="font-style: italic;">how might we</span> solve them. 
          That way we ended up with potential solutions to the problems. </p>
        <p>Again, we voted for those that we thought were applicable to our users’ needs. As a result, we gathered:
          <ul>
            <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">lookbook</span></li>
            <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">reminder</span> of the return date for rentals</li>
            <li>good <span style="font-weight: bold;">SEO</span> words</li>
            <li>highlighting <span style="font-weight: bold;">events</span> on the front page</li>

          <div>
        <h3>2x2 Matrix</h3>
        <p>After the entire process of HMW we picked some ideas from it and put them into a 2x2 Matrix 
          to <span style="font-weight: bold;">prioritize them by the impact</span> on users <span style="font-weight: bold;">and the effort</span> 
          they require. That helped us decide which features we should work on and which ones we can postpone. </p>
          <p>At that point, we decided not to pursue the catalogue with clothes and the back system to manage the membership. 
          Instead, we prioritized making a <span style="font-weight: bold;">lookbook</span> and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">front page</span> 
          with an <span style="font-weight: bold;">original design</span> that will attract new members.</p>

        <h2>Develop</h2>
      <p>
        At that stage we started working on the visual part of the solution. Because of a short deadline, 
        we decided to design <span style="font-weight: bold;">mobile version</span> of the website <span style="font-weight: bold;">first</span> 
        - primarily to ensure that we will <span style="font-weight: bold;">not overcomplicate the design</span> 
        in a way that later would be hard to translate to other devices.

          many ideas in short amount of time. After voting on elements that we liked, we move on to Figma, to create low fidelity wireframes 
          and <span style="font-weight: bold;">focus on on the functionalities</span> rather than the design. 
          At that stage we concentrated on following hierarchy rules and application of 
          the F scanning pattern to ease the users’ reading.

          At this stage, not only we added colors and content such as photos and illustrations, but we also focused more on design principles.</p>

        <p>
          We tested the usability of the project in 2 testing sessions (low-fi and high-fi) on <span style="font-weight: bold;">10 people</span> total, 
          by observing how users interact with it during <span style="font-weight: bold;">guerilla</span> tests and <span style="font-weight: bold;">think aloud</span> tests. 
          We sumed-up the process and the results in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">video</span>.

        <h3>Desktop Version</h3>
        <p>After implementing feedback on mobile high-fi, we created the desktop version of the webpage.</p>
        
        <p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">biggest challenge</span> we faced during desktop was the hero section on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">landing page</span>. 
          We had trouble with the layout of "our values" section and we have also realised that the photo doesn’t represent TCC’s message, 
          so we decided to change it to the one that show their values such as community.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The original project was <span style="font-weight: bold;">too ambitious</span> for our skills and time, 
            which we should've realized it sooner.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">During the interviews</span> we focused maybe too much on understanding the client and 
            the target audience, but we <span style="font-weight: bold;">neglected the problem and solution</span> topic.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">It’s hard to balance</span> out <span style="font-weight: bold;">bold and creative</span> 
            web design <span style="font-weight: bold;">with usability and accessibility</span>.</li>
          <li>We should have <span style="font-weight: bold;">checked</span> the <span style="font-weight: bold;">testing tasks</span> sooner - 
            the participants were confused by them at the start, which resulted in less valuable feedback.</li>
          <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Communicating with stakeholder is challenging</span>, 
            mostly because of the fast pace of the project and how long we needed to wait for client’s response.</li>
