        <h3>Client</h3>
        <p>
          The Clothing Club (TCC) is a non-profit, volunteer based organization
          in Aarhus, which works as a clothing library, where for a set price,
          its members can rent up to 3 pieces of clothing per month. They has
          existed for 5 years, but they only means of communication with the
          target audience were Instagram and Facebook posts. Recently, they
          decided to rebrand their digital presence and invest in a website.
        </p>

      <section id="problem">
        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>
          We want to increase the awareness of The Clothing Club among their
          potential customers and develop their digital presence.

        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>
          We wanted to understand how TCC’s members and potential customers feel
          about the concept, what are their reasons for joining and how would
          they describe the organization’s aesthetic. Additionally, TCC was
          discussing adding a catalogue on their website, so we wanted to learn
          the opinion of the target audience about it.
          <p>The examples of questions were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Why have you started using their service?</li>
          <li>How would you describe their aesthetic/branding?</li>
          <li>What do you think can be improved?</li>
          <li>What might be a leaning argument for you to sign up? (for the potential customers)</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>User Persona</h3>
        <p>Based on desk research and the interviews we created 2 user personas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sarah Jakobsen - a Danish student, who wants to save money and the planet at the same time.</li>
          <li>Anna Müller - an international member of The Clothing Club, who wants to become a bigger part of the community, while learning new skills.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both of them like to thrift and experiment with fashion. It helped us define our target group better and always remember their needs.</p>

          <h3>How Might We</h3>
          <div class="textImg">
        <div id="goals">
        <p>We formed How Might We questions to ideate on the potential solutions for the problems our users might face while using the website. First, we took our long-term and short-term goals for the solution from our previous research, in spirit of:
          <ul>
            <li>Promoting sustainability</li>
            <li>Attracting new members</li>
            <li>Creating an open and supportive community</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We voted for the most important and achievable outcomes</p>

        </div>
        <div class="textImg">
          
          <div>
        <p>Later we took those challenges and we asked ourselves <span style="font-style: italic;">how might we</span> solve them. That way we ended up with potential solutions to the problems. </p>
        <p>Again, we voted for those that we thought were applicable to our users’ needs. As a result, we gathered:
          <ul>
            <li>a lookbook</li>
            <li>a reminder of the return date for rentals</li>
            <li>good SEO words</li>
            <li>highlighting events on the front page</li>
          </ul>

        <article class="textImg">
          <div>
        <h3>2x2 Matrix</h3>
        <p>After the entire process of HMW we picked some ideas from it and put them into a 2x2 Matrix 
          to prioritized them by the impact on users and the effort they require. 
          That helped us decide which features we should work on and which ones we can postpone. </p>
          <p>At that point, we decided not to pursue the catalogue with clothes and the back system to manage the membership. 
          Instead, we prioritized making a <span style="font-weight: bold;">lookbook</span> and a <span style="font-weight: bold;">front page</span> with an <span style="font-weight: bold;">original design</span> that will attract new members.</p>

  <section id="develop">
        <h2>Develop</h2>
      <p>
        At that stage we started working on the visual part of the solution. Because of a short deadline, 
        we decided to design mobile version of the website first - primarily to ensure that we won’t overcomplicate 
        the design in a way that later would be hard to translate to other devices.

      <article id="lowFi">
        <h3>Low-fi Wireframes</h3>
        <p>
          First, we sketched using crazy 8 method to generate many ideas in short amount of time. 
          After voting on elements that we liked, we move on to Figma, to create low fidelity wireframes 
          and focus on on the functionalities rather than the design. 
          At that stage we concentrated on following hierarchy rules and application of 
          the F scanning pattern to ease the users’ reading.

      <article id="highFi">
        <h3>High-fi Wireframes</h3>
        <p>For the high fidelity we implemented the feedback from testing and focused more on the UI of the solution. At this stage, not only we added colors and content such as photos and illustrations, but we also focused more on design principles.</p>
      </article>

      <!--Testing-->
      <article id="testing">
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <div class="textImg">
        <p>
          We tested the usability of the project in 2 testing sessions (low-fi and high-fi) on 10 people total, 
          by observing how users interact with it during guerilla tests and think aloud tests. 
          We sumed-up the process and the results in the video.

        <h3>Desktop Version</h3>
        <p>After implementing feedback on mobile high-fi, we created the desktop version of the webpage.</p>
        
        <p>The biggest challenge we faced during desktop was the hero section on the landing page. We have realised that the photo doesn’t represent TCC’s message, so we decided to change it to the one that show their values such as community.</p>
