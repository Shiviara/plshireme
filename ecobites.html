      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        The design sprint’s focus was <span style="font-weight: bold;">using AI in the process</span>, but it was up to
        us to what extend we want to use it. Our
        task
        was to create a mock-up of a <span style="font-weight: bold;">landing page</span> for a digital product (app or
        saas) for an
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">AI generated target group</span>. We could
        chose the audience from a list generated by AI, my team decided on <span
          style="font-weight: bold;">Eco-Conscious Advocates</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their description was:<br>
        Champions of sustainability, choosing eco-friendly products and supporting green initiatives. Their purchases
        reflect
        values, promoting eco-awareness. Dedicated to a greener future through informed choices.

          <h3>Product Idea</h3>
          <p>
            We needed to come up with an app or a saas for our target group. We <span style="font-weight: bold;">asked
              chatGPT for suggestions</span>, the ones
            that got our
            attention were:
          </p>
          <!--chatGPT's ideas-->
          <ul>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Green Product Scanner App</span> - An app that allows users to scan
              product barcodes to quickly assess the
              environmental impact of items they're
              considering purchasing. It could provide information on the product's carbon footprint, packaging
              materials, and
              certifications.
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Community Eco-Action Platform</span> - A social app that connects
              like-minded Eco-Conscious Advocates, enabling
              them to share tips, success stories, and local
              eco-initiatives. It could also facilitate group activities and events.
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sustainable Food Choices App</span> - An app that provides information
              about the environmental impact of
              different foods, helping users make informed choices
              about what they eat. It could also suggest plant-based recipes and local farmers' markets.</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Carbon Offsetting App</span> - A platform that calculates users' carbon
              footprints and offers options to offset
              their emissions by supporting verified
              carbon offset projects.
            </li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plant-Based Restaurant Guide</span> - An app that helps users find
              restaurants and eateries that prioritize
              plant-based, locally sourced, and organic meals.
              Users can rate and review dishes, share photos, and discover new sustainable dining options. The app could
              also include
              a feature that calculates the carbon savings achieved by choosing plant-based meals over animal-based
              ones.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>After discussing them we formed <span style="font-weight: bold;">our idea</span> of <span
              style="font-weight: bold;">zero-waste cookbook app</span>, which helps you use-up your food
            scraps
            and find
            recipes for things that are in season for you based on your location.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>
              When we finally decided what kind of app we want to promote with our landing page, we needed to decide its
              features.
              First, we asked chatGPT for help and then we formed more structured list based on it
            </p>
            <p>Because of the sprint nature of the project we decided to minimise the amount of features to:
            <ul>
              <li>Creating and sharing recipes</li>
              <li>Suggestions of replacements for ingredients to seasonal ones</li>
              <li>Recipe category for food scraps</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <article>
          <h3>Low-fi wireframe</h3>
          <p>
            As a first step of the development we tried to get some inspiration from images generated by Adobe Firefly
            and
            Midjourney. After that we started sketching using crazy 8 method, then we decided on the idea we like the
            most and we
            looked at other landing pages to get inspiration. After that we created low-fi wireframe of the website
          </p>

        <article class="textImg">
          <div>
            <h3>Color palette</h3>
            <p>
              We tried using chatGPT to generate color palette but it was bad...
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end we chose a colorful and vibrant palette to give casual and approachable vibe, because being
              eco-friendly
              should be a everyday thing. The color palette resembles watermelon, which we also choose to make our logo,
              because
              entirety of it is edible, so it’s a zero-waste food. We also decided to continue the watermelon theme by
              coloring
              sections of the website in a way to form watermelon.
            </p>

        <article>
          <h3>Sustainable Web Design</h3>
          <p>
            To make the landing page represent the values of EcoBites (sustainability, fighting food-waste etc)
            better, we decided
            to look into sustainable web design. We did desk research about it and we also asked chatGPT how can we
            use it for EcoBites.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end we implemented:
          <ul>
            <li>Minimalistic design</li>
            <li>No videos</li>
            <li>Minimal amount of images</li>
            <li>Usage of SVGs</li>
          </ul>
