        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Smukfest, Denmark’s oldest music festival, in 2022 introduced the MinSmukfest app in collaboration with IMB,
          aiming to
          elevate the festival experience with experimental features. However, given it was a first version, the app
          wasn’t
          popular among festival attendees and there was some room for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the project we were given a task by IBM to redesign the MinSmukfest app, while paying extra attention
          to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>enhancing user experience</li>
          <li>improving engagement</li>
          <li>on-boarding the users more</li>
          <li>making the UI consistent with Smukfest’s new website</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="problem">
        <h3>Problem statement</h3>
        <p>
          How can we improve and re-envision the MinSmukfest app, to further support the attendees' experience of the
          Smukfest
          festival?

            <h3>Analysis of the existing app</h3>
            <p>
              Fist, we needed to analyse the current version of the app to be able to expend on it later. The main
              features were:
            <ul>
              <li>Find my friend - provides the attendees with an easy way to find their friends at the festival plaza
              </li>
              <li>Beautiful memories - based on users’ registered festival bracelates, after the end of Smukfest, they
                can
                see summary of
                their experience there (based on the sales data) in spotify wrapped like form</li>
              <li>Just fun - an offshoot of “Beautiful memories”, this feature uses sales data to provide users with a
                live overview of
            </ul>
          </article>

          <!--Target audience-->
          <article>
            <h3>Target audience</h3>
            <p>
              We were provided with some user data by IBM from which we could see that majority of the attendees is
              Danish
              and 46.5%
              of them are female. There were 2 big age groups,18-34 year-olds and then 35-60. We decided to focus on the
              younger
              group, because they are more likely to use apps. We conveyed interviews of people this age, who have
              attended a music
              festival and discovered that they participate in them mostly for social reasons.

            <h3>Experience mapping</h3>
            <p>
              Experience mapping was done with a participant, who didn’t attend Smukfest, but has been to other music
              festivals. From
              it we gained insight into the festival experience and what challenges may occur during it. It also helps
              us brainstorm
              new ideas that could solve some of the users' problems, especially concerning health and hygiene.
            </p>
            <p>The ideas we got were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reminders to drink water</li>
              <li>Showing showers’ availability / queue</li>
              <li>Displaying emergency tents and water stations on the map</li>
              <li>Adding a hang-over guide</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It also re-established a need for find your friend feature.</p>

              First we sketched individually on paper, using crazy 8 method, after which we voted on the ideas we liked.
              Based on
