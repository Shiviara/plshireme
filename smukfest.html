              Smukfest, Denmark’s oldest music festival, in 2022 introduced the Min Smukfest app in collaboration with
              IMB,
              aiming to
              elevate the festival experience with experimental features. However, given it was a first version, the app
              wasn’t
              popular among festival attendees and there was some room for improvement.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the project we were given a task by IBM to redesign the Min Smukfest app, while paying extra
              attention
              to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>enhancing user experience</li>
              <li>improving engagement</li>
              <li>on-boarding the users more</li>
              <li>making the UI consistent with Smukfest’s new website</li>

          How can we improve and re-envision the Min Smukfest app, to further support the attendees' experience of the

            <p>
              Fist, we needed to analyse the current version of the app to be able to expend on it later. The main
              features were:
            <ul>
              <li>Find my friend - provides the attendees with an easy way to find their friends at the festival plaza
              </li>
              <li>Beautiful memories - based on users’ registered festival bracelates, after the end of Smukfest, they
                can
                see summary of
                their experience there (based on the sales data) in spotify wrapped like form</li>
              <li>Just fun - an offshoot of “Beautiful memories”, this feature uses sales data to provide users with a
                live overview of

            <h3>Target audience</h3>
            <p>
              We were provided with some user data by IBM from which we could see that majority of the attendees is
              Danish
              and 46.5%
              of them are female. There were 2 big age groups,18-34 year-olds and then 35-60. We decided to focus on the
              younger
              group, because they are more likely to use apps. We conveyed interviews of people this age, who have
              attended a music
              festival and discovered that they participate in them mostly for social reasons.

            <h3>Experience mapping</h3>
            <p>
              Experience mapping was done with a participant, who didn’t attend Smukfest, but has been to other music
              festivals. From
              it we gained insight into the festival experience and what challenges may occur during it. It also helps
              us brainstorm
              new ideas that could solve some of the users' problems, especially concerning health and hygiene.
            </p>
            <p>The ideas we got were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reminders to drink water</li>
              <li>Showing showers’ availability / queue</li>
              <li>Displaying emergency tents and water stations on the map</li>
              <li>Adding a hang-over guide</li>

              Based on
              those, we created a low fidelity wireframe in order to concentrate on the functionalities rather than the

                After low-fi wireframe, we created style tiles, based on Smukfest’s website and the design guide given
                to us by IBM, to
                ensure consistent design throughout the app.

            <h3>High-fi Wireframes</h3>
            <p>For the high-fi we implemented feedback from testing and focused more on the UI of the app. We wanted it
              to have a fun and casual atmosphere, but at the same time not to bee too distracting for the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was responsible for designing:
            <ul>
              <li>groups for find your friend feature</li>
              <li>profile</li>
              <li>QR scanning flow</li>
              <li>settings</li>
              <li>the wave at the top of each page</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              To optimise the Find your friend feature, every user has their unique QR code in their profile that can
              be scanned while
              being added to a group instead of searching for their username. Another way to join the group is to scan
              group’s QR code.

            Collaborating with IBM <span style="font-weight: bold;">taught me to consider to potential</span> outcomes
