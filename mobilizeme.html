                    Designing new administration panel for Mobilize Me and PlaNet apps, which enables admins to manage
                    users in the system.
                    The goal was to merge their existing admin panels, while making the using the system seamless and

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mobilize Me provides neurodivergent people with digital
                        tools</span> to
                    give them more structure in life. They have created 2
                    apps for that purpose - <span style="font-weight: bold;">daily planners: Mobilize Me and
                        PlaNet</span>.
                    Both allow a family member or a caretaker of the user to
                    contribute to the process and provide more detailed instructions to each task. Those apps <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">can also be used by
                        institutions</span> - such as schools, where they can be used by teachers to give more structure
                    to
                    the students, who need it.
                    However, for that to work the <span style="font-weight: bold;">institutions need</span> to use <span
                        style="font-weight: bold;">administration panel</span> to add and manage all the users. So far,
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mobilize Me and PlaNet had separate admin panels</span>, which were
                    quite outdated and hard to use, so the <span style="font-weight: bold;">company decided to
                        merge them</span> into one <span style="font-weight: bold;">and improve their

                        <h3>Analysis of existing solutions</h3>
                        <p>
                            I started the process with analysing the existing solutions to understand how the current
                            systems work and find their
                            drawbacks.
                        </p>
                        <p>Overall, the administration panels are working ok as a tool to perform the tasks that admin
                            has,
                            but they are not very
                            intuitive and are rather outdated. The user experience could be vastly improved with usage
                            of
                            the Usability Heuristics
                            to communicate to users better how to perform certain actions and explain some processes to
                            them.</p>

                        <h4>Usability test</h4>
                        <p>In order to see what elements a regular user may struggle with and what works well, I decided
                            to
                            perform usability
                            tests. As a result the main problems of existing solutions are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>confusing labels and names</li>
                            <li>forming and managing relationships between users</li>
                            <li>moving users to different groups</li>
                            <li>time spend on creating new users</li>
                            <li>navigating groups and subgroups when there are many of them (for the big admins)</li>
                            <li>outdated visuals</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>On the other hand basic features such as creating and editing both users and groups seemed to
                            be
                            intuitive. Similarly,
                            was searching for a particular person in the system.</p>
                        <p>Some notable ideas were to put “add users” button inside a group as well as to enable
                            planners to
                            plan for a group
                            instead of only individuals.</p>

                        <p>
                            The target group turned out to be very niche and hard the generalise. Those users usually
                            are
                            either the Mobilize Me
                            employees or administrator chosen by the given institution (e.g. special school), who
                            according
                            to my client could be
                            somebody young and more tech-savvy or somebody in a boss position and older, who may
                            struggle
                            more with technology.
                            Therefore, during the design stage of my solution I will keep in mind the extreme users, who
                            may
                            struggle with
                            technology and ensure that the new system will support them with clear naming and in-app
                            explanation of the features as
                            well as prevent them from making fatal mistakes.
                        </p>
                        <p>What I knew about my target audience is that they are most likely to be Danish adults,
                            working
                            with individuals with
                            cognitive disabilities.</p>

                Based on my findings, I implemented several key features to address the identified issues. These
                features included a
                search bar for both users and groups, enhanced guidance with tooltips, expendable lists of subgroups,
                and the ability
                for planners to set activities for groups and individuals. I ensured that the most frequently used
                functions are easily
                accessible, while the rest is available in hamburger menus
            </p>

                    <p>
                        Based on the user flow I’ve sketched different layouts of the administration panel screens to
                        generate different ideas.
                        Then I’ve recreated the best ones as the low fidelity wireframes in Figma.

                    <p>
                        I kept the idea of a sidebar from PlaNet’s admin panel, but I added the drop-downs to the
                        subgroups overview as well as
                        a search bar for all groups and users under the admin’s account. The buttons create a new user
                        and create a new group
                        have been put there as well, because they impact the whole system and not only the opened group.
                    </p>
                    <p>To address the issue of users getting lost in the big amount of subgroups I decided to create 3
                        limited types of groups:
                        institution, subgroup and task group, where subgroups can exist only under institutions and task
                        groups are only in
                        subgroups. Which minimises the longest possible chain of groups to (mega institution) →
                        institution → subgroup → task
                        group. Task groups (on pic subgroups) were created to allow planners to assign activities to a
                        group of people instead
                        of just individuals, thus make their work quicker.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this point I discarded the feature of bulk user creation due to logistics. Importing the
                        excel sheet would only
                        provide general user information - the admins would still need to assign them roles, put them in
                        groups and create
                        relations - so in fact the creation process would not be much quicker.

                    <p>For the high-fidelity wireframes I implemented the feedback from previous testing, replaced
                        placeholder text with
                        content and focused more on the UI of the solution. I decided to work with a mostly
                        monochromatic color palette, to
                        create a cohesive look and ensure that the solution does not seem too overwhelming.

                    <h3>UX writing</h3>
                    <div class="textImg">
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                One of the crucial parts of making the administration panel easy to navigate for users
                                (especially new ones) is good UX
                                writing. To ensure clear communication between users and the system I focused on the
                                microcopy
                            </p>
                            <p>Good examples of it are the options in the hamburger menu for groups, where every feature
                                starts with a
                                different, actionable verb. Moreover, the scope of the feature behind the buttons is
                                clear
                                based on the name (e.g.
                                export list of users)</p>
                            <p>Another place where UX writing was important are the delete pop-ups. The title shows what
                                is
                                being deleted to clearly
                                communicate to the user what is happening and the description tells the consequences of
                                continuing the admin. The
                                buttons cancel give an option to exit, while delete group further confirms what will
                                happen
                                after clicking it.</p>

                                Developing a comprehensive onboarding was essential to help new users quickly
                                familiarize
                                themselves with the system,

                            <p>Before jumping into creating a guided tour for the administration panel, first I ensured

                                are available to the users. I focused on empty states, onboarding on-demand and only
                                then
                                planned guided tour for the
                                extreme users that would need it.</p>
